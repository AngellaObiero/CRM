# A Knowledge-based Platform for Informed Customer Interaction

This is a web-based system that incorporates sentiment analysis for content from Twitter to better understand customers through their engagement with companies on Twitter thus helping build customer knowledge for more informed and relevant company-to-client engagement.

I presented this as my final year project and at the Microsoft 4frica mentorship program, 2019, to which I was awarded among the top 6 finalists upon completion of the program.
